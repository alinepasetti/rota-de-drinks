# HeyFriday
HeyFriday promotes themed and exclusive tours around the world. The user can pay for them using a credit card (Stripe integrated). After the purchase, the user is going to use the web app on their mobile and perform the listed activities to get a reward at the end!

## How does it work?
- At the homepage, the user can find a list of experiences to purchase
- In the experience detail, HeyFridays presents a summary of the tour, who else bought it, a map with all the stops it covers
- To buy the event, the user must be logged in and have at least one credit card saved into his account
- After the purchase, they can start the experience right away. Each stop has a dedicated page which includes the location in the map and what the user needs to perform there
- At the end of every experience, the user will receive a unique badge that will be added to their profile. 
- The public user profiles present basic information about the user (photo, name, location, bio) and a list of the badges they've collected
- In the private profile, the user can see a list of the Next Events (the ones they bought but did not experience) and a list of Past Events (the ones that are already completed)
